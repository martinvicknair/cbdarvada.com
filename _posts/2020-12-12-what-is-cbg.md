Cannabigerol, or CBG, is one of over 100 naturally-occurring cannabinoids found in cannabis plants. CBG is a non-intoxicating cannabinoid, meaning it won’t create a “high” like THC does. Cannabinoids are chemical compounds that interact with the human body through the endocannabinoid receptors located throughout the body. CBG is considered a minor cannabinoid because most cannabis plants contain only small amounts of CBG. Some hemp plants are bred to produce higher levels of CBG early in the plant’s life cycle, limiting the production of other cannabinoids, which creates hemp that can be used to make CBG products.<br /><br /><a href="https://cbdarvada.com/as/cbg">https://cbdarvada.com/as/cbg</a><span> </span>
