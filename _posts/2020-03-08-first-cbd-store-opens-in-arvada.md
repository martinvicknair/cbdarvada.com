<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The store is part of the CBD American Shaman franchise, which has about 150 stores throughout the US. The Arvada shop in the first of the brand in Colorado.<br>CBD is a non-psychoactive compound found in hemp, which may help with pain, inflammation, anxiety and depression, though medical studies confirming its potential benefits are still being conducted.“Nothing in the store can get anybody high,” said Randy Lierz, co-owner of Arvada American Shaman.<br>This has been a concern of some Arvada community members as the city of Arvada does not allow retail marijuana sales.<br>Sheils sees the store as a place for people who are interested in CBD products to come and learn without having to go to a dispensary — many of which sell CBD in addition to marijuana.<br>“The dispensaries that make CBD products more often than not are making it from the marijuana plant,” Sheils said. “When we make ours, everything is coming from the hemp plant. The hemp plant produces a more quality-CBD.”<br>A water soluble hemp oil is the top selling item at Arvada American Shaman. That along with the anti-inflammatory topical cream are available to sample at the store. </p><cite>https://arvadapress.com/stories/first-cbd-store-opens-in-arvada,277554?</cite></blockquote>
