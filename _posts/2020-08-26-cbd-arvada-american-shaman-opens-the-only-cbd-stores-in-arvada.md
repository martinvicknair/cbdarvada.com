<p>The residents of Arvada can now benefit from the city’s two CBD stores, located at 6695 Wadsworth Blvd. and a second location at 11651 W 64th Ave. Owned by Bridget Sheils and Randy Lierz, CBD Arvada American Shaman is a franchise, providing a complete line of CBD American Shaman products including topical creams and oils, candies and more. In addition, they have a Compassionate Care program, which offers discounts for people with chronic conditions.</p>

<p>“We are here to help. Our goal is to put CBD in the hands of those who can reap the benefits! Reach the ones who are suffering from anxiety, depression, epilepsy, cancer, PTSD, opioid addiction, those struggling to maintain focus, and those in need of pain management,” said co-owner Bridget Sheils. With this being the only CBD store in Arvada, relief is just a moment away.</p>
